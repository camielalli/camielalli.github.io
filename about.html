                    <p class = 'text'>Hey, I am Camie, a linguist and cognitive scientist interested
                        in everything related to language, cognition and evolution, from the neural correlates 
                        of language to linguistic complexity, from comparative cognition to human evolution,
                        and from embodied cognition to multimodal language. I hold a BA in Modern Languages
                        and Literature from the University of Pisa, and an MSc in Linguistics from the 
                        University of Edinburgh. In my research, I privilege domains and methodologies which 
                        allow to connect in an original and productive way disciplines and approaches apparently 
                        unrelated, integrating concepts from Philosophy, Anthropology, Psychology and Artificial Intelligence. 
                        I use behavioural experiments as well as computational models to simulate linguistic dynamics. 
                        On a more personal note, I consider myself to be a curious, energetic and motivated individual 
                        with a passion for learning and discovering new things.</p>
                        <p class = 'text'>When I am not working you can find me doing a mix of other things: 
                            running, while listening to epic soundtracks and taking pictures of the scenery; 
                            watching Netflix, while sipping coffee or tea (depending on the time of day); 
                            or attempting to teach myself Tai Chi and Japanese Calligraphy. I also enjoy art, 
                            music and history. I am an avid reader of British literature.</p>
                        <p class = 'text'>In the past, I attended a bunch of summer schools around Europe, 
                            worked several student jobs, au paired in Britain and almost became famous 
                            in Denmark – was interviewed by DR1 on my experience learning Danish. 
                            I have a doppelganger: Claudia from the Dragon Prince – I’ve been slightly worried 
                            about my hair since I discovered her. In the future, I would like to learn to play 
                            the piano and improve my photography skills.</p>
                        <p class = 'text'>Please feel free to get in touch, 
                            if there’s anything you would like to discuss with me. 
                            I am always happy to chat about my research and other interests! 😊
