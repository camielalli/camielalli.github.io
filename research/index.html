                <p class = "text1">How does structure emerge in language? What can linguistic universals tell us about our mind? But also, why is there so much variation across the languages of the world? These are some of the questions that keep me awake at night. To find answers, I will soon start my PhD at the <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/" target="_blank">MPI for Psycholinguistics</a> working in the LEADS group – Language Evolution and Adaptation to Diverse Situation – under the supervision of <a href="https://www.limorravivevolang.com/" target="_blank">Dr Limor Raviv</a>, <a href="https://https://www.simonkirby.net/" target="_blank">Professor Simon Kirby</a> and <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/fisher-simon-e" target="_blank">Professor Simon Fisher</a>. 
                    <br><br>My doctoral project aims to bridge socio- and evolutionary linguistics. Personally, I find the Linguistic Niche Hypothesis (LNH) one of the most intriguing answers to why languages show such a high degree of variation. According to LNH, it is the environment, social or physical, that shapes the features of a language [1]. This idea has been around for centuries, dating back to Greek historian Herodotus, but it has gained attention in recent years thanks to technological advances which allow to test it empirically. Thanks to computer simulations, various properties of social networks, such as size, structure, connectivity and proportion of native and non-native speakers, can now be isolated and their effect on language striucture can be assessed separately [2-4]. In other words, it is now possible to build computer models which simulate the communicative dynamics of real populations. These models are often substantiated by the findings of behavioural experiments.
                    <br><br>Some of the most compelling results of these models are that larger populations create structurally simpler languages, whereas smaller communities speak languages with more complex structural features [4]. Similarly, the degree of complexity is smaller for languages spoken by sparsely connected networks compared to densely connected networks [3]. The finding of [4] was confirmed by the results of the first behavioural study in the field, which. using groups of four and eight participants, showed that the latter converge more quickly on a more transparent and generalisable language [5].
                    <br><br>My doctoral project seeks to combine these methodologies to assess the effect of two social factors, yet non-investigated experimentally: age and gender. Sociolinguistic studies have interestingly observed a differential pattern of linguistic behaviour linked to gender and age. Women have been found to be more innovative and adopt new forms more frequently compared to men. Similarly, adolescents introduce innovations with a higher frequency than adults. In my PhD, I am interested in finding answers to the following three questions:
                    <br><br>1.	Are the behaviours observed in the real world also observed in the lab?
                    <br><br>2.	What are the factors behind these differential behaviours?
                    <br><br>3.	What implications do these results have for language evolution?
                    <br><br>If, like me, you are excited to find answers to these questions, follow my blog where I will give updates on the progress of my PhD. 😊

                    Apart from this project, I am also involved in the Ecolang Project under the supervion of Professor Vigliocco at UCL, 
                    where we are trying to understand how multimodal cues contribute to language comprehension and acquisition.
